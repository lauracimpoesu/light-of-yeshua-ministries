              Light of Yeshua Ministries is a Spirit-filled evangelistic
              movement devoted to boldly proclaiming the Gospel of Christ Jesus
              (YESHUA) through street evangelism across nations.
              <br /> <br />
              Founded on unwavering biblical principles, we are called to reach
              the lost, the broken, and the forgotten with the truth that sets
              souls free.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              We believe that the Bible is the inspired, infallible Word of
              God/YHWH â€” our ultimate authority in all things. We boldly affirm
              that Jesus is God Almighty, fully ONE WITH The Father and The Holy
              Spirit (Colossians 2:9).
            </p>{" "}

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
              Empowered by His Spirit, we go into the streets, cities, and
              nations to declare the message of repentance, salvation, and
              eternal life through Yeshua.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our mission is not only to lead people into the Light and love of
              Christ, but also to expose the works of darkness (Ephesians 5:11)
              and call the world back to righteousness, holiness, and truth.
